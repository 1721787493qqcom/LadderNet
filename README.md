# LadderNet
* This is repository for my paper [LadderNet: Multi-path networks based on U-Net for medical image segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07810). <br>
* This implementation is based on [orobix implementation](https://github.com/orobix/retina-unet). Main difference is the structure of the model.

# Requirement
* Python3 
* PyTorch 0.4
* configparser

# How to run
* run "python prepare_datasets_DRIVE.py" to generate hdf5 file of training data
* run "cd src"
* run ""
